# OgmaNeo, V2

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ogmaneo/Lobby](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg)](https://gitter.im/ogmaneo/Lobby) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo)

## Introduction 

Welcome to the [Ogma](https://ogmacorp.com) OgmaNeo2 library, C++ library that contains an implementation of Sparse Predictive Hierarchies.

For an introduction to how the algorithm works, see [the presentation](./OgmaNeo_Presentation.pdf).

There is a [deprecated version](https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo) of this repository that contains an outdated implementation of SPH. Please use this version of OgmaNeo (OgmaNeo2, this repository) if possible.

## Installation

### CMake

Version 3.1+ of [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is required when building the library.

### Building

The following commands can be used to build the OgmaNeo library:

> git clone https://github.com/ogmacorp/OgmaNeo2.git  
> cd OgmaNeo2
> mkdir build  
> cd build  
> cmake ..  
> make  
> make install

The `cmake` command can be passed a `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to determine where to install the library and header files.  

The `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` boolean cmake option can be used to create dynamic/shared object library (default is to create a _static_ library). On Linux it's recommended to add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` (especially if you plan to use the Python bindings in PyOgmaNeo2).

Multithreading can be disabled by setting the `DISABLE_THREADING` boolean cmake option to `On`.

`make install` can be run to install the library. `make uninstall` can be used to uninstall the library.

On **Windows** systems it is recommended to use `cmake-gui` to define which generator to use and specify optional build parameters, such as `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
